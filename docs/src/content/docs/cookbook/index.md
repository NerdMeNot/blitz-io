description: Practical recipes and patterns for building real applications with blitz-io.
---

Welcome to the blitz-io cookbook. This is a collection of self-contained, practical recipes that show you how to solve the problems you will actually encounter when building networked services, concurrent pipelines, and production systems with blitz-io. Each recipe combines the core APIs -- networking, channels, sync primitives, and timers -- into patterns you can adapt and drop into your own projects.

:::tip[Where to Start]
If you are new to blitz-io, begin with **[Echo Server](/cookbook/echo-server)** to learn the networking fundamentals, then move to **[Timeout Patterns](/cookbook/timeout-patterns)** to see how timers and deadlines work. Together, these two recipes cover the building blocks used by every other recipe in the cookbook.

## Recipes at a Glance

The recipes are ordered from foundational concepts to more involved production patterns. Work through the beginner recipes first -- the intermediate ones build directly on the ideas introduced there.

### Getting Started

These recipes cover the core APIs and are the best entry points into the library.

| Recipe | Difficulty | What You Will Build |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Echo Server](/cookbook/echo-server) | **Beginner** | A TCP server that accepts connections and echoes data back. Covers `TcpListener`, `TcpStream`, and spawning a task per connection. |
| [HTTP Server](/cookbook/http-server) | **Beginner/Intermediate** | An HTTP/1.1 server from raw TCP -- request parsing, path routing, static file serving, and JSON responses. |
| [Timeout Patterns](/cookbook/timeout-patterns) | **Beginner** | Deadline checks around operations, retry with exponential backoff, and deadline propagation across nested calls. |
| [Parallel Tasks](/cookbook/parallel-tasks) | **Beginner** | Health-check dashboard using `joinAll`, `tryJoinAll`, `race`, and `select` to probe services concurrently. |
| [Producer/Consumer](/cookbook/producer-consumer) | **Beginner** | A job queue built on bounded `Channel` with multiple producers, multiple consumers, backpressure, and clean shutdown via poison pill. |

### Networking and Messaging

Patterns for real-time communication and event distribution between clients and services.

| Recipe | Difficulty | What You Will Build |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Chat Server](/cookbook/chat-server) | **Intermediate** | A multi-client chat server using `BroadcastChannel` for message fan-out, with per-client tasks and disconnect handling. |
| [Pub/Sub System](/cookbook/pub-sub) | **Intermediate** | An event bus with typed events and topic-based routing, built on `BroadcastChannel` with subscriber lifecycle management and backpressure handling. |

### Resource Management

Techniques for controlling access to shared resources -- connection pools, rate limits, and semaphore-gated concurrency.

| Recipe | Difficulty | What You Will Build |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Connection Pool](/cookbook/connection-pool) | **Intermediate** | A semaphore-gated resource pool with acquire/release, health checks on checkout, timeout on acquire, and pool sizing guidance. |
| [Rate Limiter](/cookbook/rate-limiter) | **Intermediate** | A token bucket rate limiter built on `Semaphore` and `Interval`, with per-client limiting and a sliding window variant. |

### Data Processing

File and process pipelines for reading, transforming, and writing data.

| Recipe | Difficulty | What You Will Build |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| [File Pipeline](/cookbook/file-pipeline) | **Intermediate** | A log analyzer using `readDir`, `BufReader`, `Lines` for line-by-line processing, atomic writes, and parallel file I/O with `spawnBlocking`. |
| [Process Pipeline](/cookbook/process-pipeline) | **Intermediate** | A build orchestrator that runs subprocesses with `Command`, captures stdout/stderr, chains commands, and enforces timeouts. |

### Lifecycle and Operations

Production concerns: shutdown sequencing, configuration changes, and keeping the event loop responsive under mixed workloads.

| Recipe | Difficulty | What You Will Build |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Work Offloading](/cookbook/work-offloading) | **Intermediate** | CPU-bound vs I/O-bound separation using the blocking pool (and, in the future, Blitz). Keeps compute-heavy work from starving the event loop. |
| [Config Hot-Reload](/cookbook/config-hot-reload) | **Intermediate** | Live configuration updates via `Watch` channel. File-change detection triggers an atomic swap that notifies all consumers without restarts. |
| [Graceful Drain](/cookbook/graceful-drain) | **Intermediate** | Signal-triggered shutdown using `Shutdown` and `WorkGuard`. Drains in-flight connections, tracks outstanding requests, and performs ordered cleanup. |

### Advanced

Capstone recipes that combine multiple patterns into realistic applications.

| Recipe | Difficulty | What You Will Build |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Service Mesh](/cookbook/service-mesh) | **Advanced** | A reverse proxy combining connection pooling, rate limiting, health checks, graceful shutdown, and backend routing into one application. |

## Prerequisites

All recipes assume you have:

1. **Zig 0.15.2+** installed
2. **blitz-io** added as a dependency in `build.zig.zon`
3. Familiarity with basic Zig syntax (error unions, optionals, slices)

If any recipe uses a feature beyond these basics, it will call that out at the top.

## How to Read the Recipes

Every recipe follows a consistent structure so you can quickly find what you need:

- **Problem statement** -- what we are building and why it matters
- **Complete code** -- a working example you can copy directly into your project
- **Walkthrough** -- step-by-step explanation of the key design decisions
- **Variations** -- alternative approaches, extensions, and trade-offs to consider

Code examples use the `io` import alias throughout:

```zig
const io = @import("blitz-io");
```

All examples target the non-blocking polling API (`tryAccept`, `tryRead`, `trySend`, `tryRecv`), which works today without requiring the full async runtime scheduler. When the scheduler-integrated Future API is used, it is called out explicitly.
